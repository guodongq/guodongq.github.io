Hey, I'am guodong, You can call me bruce. I major in Computer Network Engineering and began to work in 2012. During
several years of working experience, most of the work is related to back-end development.

I have participated in a few projects, and I also used several programming languages such as java, python, golang and so
on. Now I mainly focus on golang R & D and I hope to go further in technology.

I have some hobbies, while not working I like to be outside, either running or playing pingpong. I also like reading
books and watching movies.

This page is mainly used to publish several of my personal findings, notes, technology sharing, etc. I'am looking
forward to growing with you and making progress together.
